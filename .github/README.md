# ForgeRoot

GitHub repository as a living Forge Mind.

ForgeRoot turns a repository into a self-improving, PR-native, evolvable intelligence. The durable identity layer lives in Git and `.forge`; the GitHub App and runtime DBs are control-plane machinery around that identity.

## Current bootstrap status

Completed bootstrap tasks in this working tree:

- `T001` — monorepo skeleton and `.forge/` root
- `T003` — initial `mind.forge` and constitution policy
- `T004` — `.forge` v1 spec and JSON Schema
- `T005` — canonical parser/hash kernel seed
- `T006` — minimum GitHub App manifest and permissions
- `T007` — webhook ingest with HMAC verification
- `T008` — event inbox and delivery GUID idempotency
- `T014` — runtime mode and kill switch
- `T015` — issue intake classifier

The next natural task is `T016` plan spec DSL.

## Core laws

1. Git is the source of truth.
2. `.forge` is the genome and curated memory layer.
3. PR is the only evolution transport.
4. No direct default-branch writes.
5. Federation and spawning start allowlisted/lab-only.
6. Runtime mutation must be stoppable by an explicit kill switch.
7. Only `forge:auto`-labeled intake can enter the automatic planner candidate lane.

## Current executable surfaces

```bash
# .forge parser/hash kernel, in a Rust-enabled environment
cargo test -p forge-kernel

# GitHub App webhook, inbox, runtime mode, and kill switch tests
cd apps/github-app
npm run test

# Planner intake classifier tests
cd packages/planner
npm run test
```

## GitHub App runtime

`apps/github-app` currently provides:

- raw-body webhook signature verification
- T006 event/action allowlist
- accepted webhook envelope normalization
- SQLite event inbox table
- `X-GitHub-Delivery` idempotency
- retryable vs terminal event failure states
- runtime modes: `observe`, `propose`, `evolve`, `federate`, `quarantine`, `halted`
- admin-token-protected kill switch endpoint
- repeated 403/429 downgrade hook

## Planner package

`packages/planner` currently provides:

- deterministic issue/comment/alert intake classification
- 14 intake categories
- `accept` / `ignore` / `block` / `escalate` routing
- strict `forge:auto` label handling
- normalized task candidates with one-task-one-PR planner hints

## Design documents

- `00_ForgeRoot_blueprint_設計書.md` — fixed v1 design source
- `01_単語や命名規則.md` — naming and terminology rules
- `02_README.md` — public README source draft
- `03_issue.md` — bounded issue drafts
- `docs/specs/forge-v1.md` — `.forge` v1 specification
- `docs/specs/issue-intake.md` — T015 issue intake classifier specification
- `docs/ops/event-inbox.md` — T008 inbox operations
- `docs/ops/runtime-mode.md` — T014 runtime mode and kill switch operations

## Non-goals

ForgeRoot is not designed to bypass GitHub governance. It is designed to make autonomous maintenance auditable, reversible, and evolvable inside Git-native constraints.

Still intentionally out of scope at this point:

- full planner/executor/auditor loop
- production scheduler
- full replay engine
- mutation runtime
- federation runtime
- browser extension UI
